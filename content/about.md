This site's posts and content are written by me, Matthew Tong! I'm a Christian, a musician, an aspiring stenographer, and a gaming/tech enthusiast.

On the music end of things, I've played piano since I was 4, cello since 10, and then went on to study cello for 4 years in college and piano (specifically collaborative piano) for 2 years in grad school.

For steno, I began my journey in 2022, and am currently working on dictations at speeds of 120 wpm.

You can find a bunch of records of things I do on my YouTube channel.
