This site's posts and content are created by me, Matthew Tong. I'm a Christian, a musician, an aspiring stenographer, and a gaming/tech hobbyist.

On the music end of things, I've played piano since I was 4, cello since 10, and then went on to study cello for 4 years in college and piano (specifically collaborative piano) for 2 years in grad school.

For steno, I began my journey in 2022, and am currently working on dictations at speeds of 120 wpm.

You can find some of the things I do on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@mattmtong).

This site was setup primarily through the use of [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/hjD9jTi_DQ4?si=w5fSLJBZ9vXeUqTL). My domain is registered through [Hover](https://www.hover.com).
