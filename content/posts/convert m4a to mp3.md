This is a tutorial on how to convert an M4A file that you made in Voice Memos into an MP3 file that is more easily used by non-Apple devices.

Open Voice Memos.
Tap on the recording you want to convert.
Tap the "..." menu button
Tap "Save to Files".
Find the location you would like to save this file to and remember it.  In this example, I'm saving it in iCloud Drive > Voice Memos.

Then open your web browser of choice (Safari for me) and head to www.convertio.co.
Tap on "Choose Files" and then again on "Choose Files" in the dropdown menu.
This is where you have to find the file you just saved and then select it to be uploaded to this website.

Now tap the "..." menu icon and select MP3 from the selections of file formats.
Tap "Convert" and the website should change to a progress site that shows that the file is being converted.

Once the blue "Download" button appears, you can tap that, and tap "Download" again in the dialog box that pops up.
Then you'll see (at least in Safari) right next the URL bar a little down-arrow download icon with a circle around it to indicate progress.  Once it is fully circled, the download is complete.  Tap on it.

After tapping on the download icon, tap "Downloads" from the dropdown menu, and you will see the file that was just converted.
Tap the magnifying glass icon to go back to the location of the file in the Files app.  
You can now share or do whatever you'd like with this newly converted MP3 file.
