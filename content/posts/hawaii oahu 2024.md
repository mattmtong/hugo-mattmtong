I took a 5-day trip to Oahu! Here's a chronological account of the things I did. Skip to the Index if you'd like to see a simple list of all the places I visited.

# Day 1

I'm viewing the flight to Oahu as part of the Oahu trip, so our journey begins at the ONT airport. The day before, I had gone to get some coffee buns at [Sobok Sobok](https://www.yelp.com/biz/sobok-sobok-rowland-heights). The quality of the buns there has always been consistently pleasing, in both texture and flavor. The buns taste best warm, but they hold up nicely overnight and provide a comfortable breakfast bite while we awaited our boarding time at our departure gate.
